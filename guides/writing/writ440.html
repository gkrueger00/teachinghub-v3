<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">COURSE RATIONALE</a><a class="headerlink" href="#course-rationale" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Accounting students need to be effective communicators if they are to
succeed in their careers, yet many of them lack the communication skills
they need. Almost everyone in the field would agree that there is a need
to help students become better communicators, especially better writers.</p>
<p>The WRIT 440 class offers a unique opportunity to help accounting
students become better writers (and speakers) about accounting. Writing
with precision and clarity about accounting topics can best be taught
within the context of an accounting class, whether this class is a
regular accounting course like principles or intermediate accounting, or
a special course in communication for accounting students.</p>
<p>Teaching writing within an accounting context offers at least two
important advantages. Assignments in this class are designed to help
students learn to write the kinds of documents they will encounter in
the workplace. Thus, they will gain practical experience and a chance to
build usable, job-related skills.</p>
<p>The second advantage is that students are likely to find the writing
assignments assigned to be meaningful, since they can see the connection
between the assignments and job requirements. If they find the
assignments relevant to future job success, they may be motivated to do
their best work and to improve areas where they are weak.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">MOTVIATING STUDENTS TO WRITE WELL</a><a class="headerlink" href="#motviating-students-to-write-well" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If WRIT 440 students are to improve their communication skills, they
must be convinced that they will need these skills to succeed in their
careers. Even after students are convinced they need to be good writers,
however, there still may be attitudinal problems. Many WRIT 440 students
dislike writing, and they have not had many courses requiring them to
write expository assignments. Some are afraid to write for fear of
failure. These negative attitudes might result from bad experiences
they’ve had in other classes, especially classes where they received
too much negative feedback on their papers.</p>
<p>One way to overcome these attitudes is to stress to attributes about the
WRIT 440 class:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>They will be writing <em>about accounting</em>, which they both understand
and find interesting. Papers written about accounting topics should
be easier for them than an analysis of a poem or a research paper
for a History class.</p></li>
<li><p>Documents written for business, such as memos and letters, should be
both simple and direct. Many students will find this type of writing
easier than the elaborate rhetorical styles encouraged in some
disciplines.</p></li>

<p>This particular course outline is structured for a regular,
full-semester online section of WRIT 440. This outline can be adapted or
changed depending on the length of term, learning modality, or
individual preferences of the instructor.</p>
<p>The course is structured into a series of modules with various readings
and assignments due each week within the module. A typical semester
course outline is as follows:</p>

<p><em>Module 3</em>: Standard English: Grammar, Punctuation, and Spelling</p>
<p><em>Module 4</em>: Understanding Audience</p>
<p><em>Module 5</em>: Organizing Documents for Clarity and Conciseness</p>
<p><em>Module 6</em>: Memorandums and Emails</p>
<p><em>Module 7</em>: Ethics in Accounting</p>
<p><em>Module 8</em>: Understanding Formal Letters</p>
<p><em>Module 9</em>: Researching for Accountants and the Literature
Review/Annotated Bibliography (either assignment can be used, but
students should be assigned a substantive research-gathering assignment
where they have to collect and analyze secondary sources on an
accounting topic)</p>
<p><em>Module 10</em>: The Literature Review/The Annotation Bibliography</p>
<p><em>Module 11</em>: Writing for Employment</p>
<p><em>Module 12</em>: Introduction to White Papers</p>

<p><strong>*MODULE ASSIGNMENTS*</strong>: (some assignments correspond with Chapter 1 of
the textbook)</p>
<p>1. Chris May Video Presentation: this short video from Chris May, CPA
MBA, Chief Financial Officer of Mesilla Valley Hospice. In this video,
she talks briefly about the different types of writing accountants
perform every day in their profession and why they are important.
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WBpALy_kUU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WBpALy_kUU</a>. After viewing the
presentation, write a short paragraph that addresses some of these
questions/issues. What surprised you about what Chris said? Did you
expect that accountants would have to do those various types of writing
tasks? Why or why not? Do any of those tasks she mentioned make your
nervous? Do you feel particularly skilled in any one of those tasks? Why
or why not?</p>
<p>2. In the <em>Effective Writing: A Handbook for Accountants</em> textbook,
read Chapter 1 (<em>Accountants as Communicators</em>), paying close attention
to the <em>Tips for the Effective Writer</em>, Figure 1.1 on page 5. Then, read
the attached accounting article from Forbes on the IRS wanting to change
rules on inherited IRA distributions. After reading the article,
consider how effective or ineffective do you find the writing? If you
have trouble reading or understanding what you read, is the problem due
to ineffective writing? If you find the material understandable and
interesting to read, what qualities of writing contribute to this
effectiveness? Refer back to the effective writing tips on page 5 to
support your points/ideas.</p>
<p>Respond to the questions above in a well-written response of at least
100 words (or about 1, typed and double-spaced page, in Times New Roman
or Calibri font only preferred) and submit the response to me an
attachment.</p>
<p>3. For this assignment, look at several published corporate SEC Forms
10-K or annual reports for the most recent year from a company and find
a section from the financial disclosure section(s) they contain. These
can be found by following the links to the listed companies at the New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE) website at www.nyse.com/idex or by going to
www.annualreports.com/</p>
<p>Select a small section of the disclosure that you think is poorly
written and revise it to make it more clear and understandable. In your
submission to me, include the name of the report, where it was found
(NYSE or annualreports.com) and include the small poorly written passage
and then your revision. The entire length of this assignment should be
no longer than one-page, typed and double-spaced using Times New Roman
or Calibri font only.</p>
<p>Please submit the completed assignment to me as an attachment.</p>
<p>3. Discussion Board Post 2: “Soft Skills” for Accountants: Research the
topic “soft skills” and provide a definition and why you think they are
important to the accounting profession. Indicate where you found the
information. In your response to your classmates’ posts, do you agree
with the definition and its importance? Why or why not? Do you have any
personal experience where not understanding soft skills was a problem?

<p>Accounting is much more than financial statements and debits and

communication. Written and oral communication gives the numbers meaning,
context, and focus on a decision.</p>
<p>Incorrect spelling or a lack of punctuation may create confusion. Your
audience may be left guessing what you are trying to say. Spelling
errors and grammatical mistakes may also change the meaning of your
message, which might result in misinformation. Some readers may get back
to you to clarify, others might not; which, in the case of new
prospects/customers, is something you want to avoid. You do not want
poor grammar to cost you business opportunities. In addition, reflective
writing can help you learn from a particular practical experience.
Reflective writing helps you make connections between what you are
taught in theory and what you need to do in practice. Reflection equals
learning.</p>

<h4>MODULE DESCRIPTION<a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>When you’re in the process of writing a document as an accountant, it’s
easy to forget that you are actually writing to someone. Whether you’ve
thought about it consciously or not, you always write to an audience:
sometimes your audience is a very generalized group of readers,
sometimes you know the individuals who compose the audience, and
sometimes you write for yourself. Keeping your audience in mind while
you write can help you make good decisions about what material to
include, how to organize your ideas, and how best to support your
argument.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id6">
<h4>MODULE OBJECTIVES<a class="headerlink" href="#id6" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>After completing readings and assignments in this module, students

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Analyze an audience</p></li>
<li><p>Select appropriate tone, language, and format to reach a given
audience</p></li>
<li><p>Determine effective content for a message</p></li>

<p>2. LinkedIn is the world’s largest professional network on the
internet. LinkedIn can be used to find the right job or internship,
connect and strengthen professional relationships, and learn the skills
you need to succeed in your career. The program can be accessed from a
desktop, LinkedIn mobile app, mobile web experience, or the LinkedIn
Lite Android mobile app.</p>
<p>More importantly, a complete LinkedIn profile is an example of
understanding audience because as a student and future accounting
professional, the program can help you connect with opportunities by
showcasing your unique professional story through experience, skills,
and education. You can also use LinkedIn to organize offline events,
join groups, write articles, post photos and videos, and more.</p>

<p>The better you can understand your audience, the better you can tailor
your communications to reach them. To understand them, a key step is to
perceive clearly who they are, what they are interested in, what they
need, and what motivates them. This ability to perceive is important
with audience members from distinct groups, generations, and even
cultures. William Seiler and Melissa BeallSeiler, W., &amp; Beall, M.

<p>As an accountant, you will be working with a variety of colleagues and
clients, including different departments within an accounting firm.
Communicating effectively is extremely important for success, especially
if you are just beginning your career in the accounting field.</p>
<p>Accountants depend on all sorts of communication methods on a daily
basis. They could spend their day answering emails, responding to texts,
having face-to-face meetings, or even giving presentations. In all these
tasks, one needs to be able to relay information as concisely, quickly,

unambiguous modifiers, and pronouns.</p></li>
<li><p>Write readable sentences: voice, variety, and tone</p></li>

<p>1. Reflection Essay 2: In reflective writing, you are trying to write
down some of the thinking that you have been through while carrying out
a particular practical activity, such as writing an essay, teaching a
class or selling a product. Through reflection, you should be able to
make sense of what you did and why and perhaps help yourself to do it
better next time.  Reflective writing gives you the chance think about
what you are doing more deeply and to learn from your experience. You
have the opportunity to discover how what you are taught in class helps
you with your real-world or academic tasks. Writing your thoughts down
makes it easier for you to think about them and make connections between
what you are thinking, what you are being taught and what you are doing.
Your written reflection will also serve as a source of reference and
evidence in the future.</p>
<p>For this reflection assignment, reconsider the information learned about
audience. What did you learn about audience that you didn’t know before?
What, specifically, can help you as an accountant who writes
correspondence consider audience more strongly? Were there any
assignments that really helped you learn more about audience? Do we need
to consider audience more or less when we we write? Why? You can address
some of these questions or address any issue related to audience not
addressed in these question prompts.</p>
<p>Write a reflection essay addressing the following questions above. The
reflection should be around 300 words, typed and double-spaced, and
written using Times New Roman or Calibri font only. Good writing
principles (including good use of grammar) are requirements for the
assignment.</p>

<li><p>Lecture Notes/Activity: Importance of Organizing Information</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Lecture Notes on Organizing Information for Documents</p>
<p>WRIT 440</p>
<p>Organization is the key to clear writing. Organize your document using
key elements, an organizing principle, and an outline. Organize your
paragraphs and sentences so that your audience can understand them, and
use transitions to move from one point to the next.</p>
<p>Successful business writers, even accountants writing documents, must
meet their audience’s needs. Organization is one more way to do that.
When a document is well-organized, readers can easily get the
information they need. Good organization also helps readers see the
connections between ideas.</p>
<p>We know that time is one of the biggest constraints in modern business
communication. Most people get a lot of emails, and so often must skim.
If you can’t capture your audience’s attention in the first few seconds,
you risk losing it completely. When organizing business documents, we,
therefore, need to ask ourselves some questions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is the most important thing for the audience to know?</p></li>
<li><p>What does the audience need to know first? Second?</p></li>
<li><p>How can I draw attention to key points using organizational aids
like headings and bullet points?</p></li>
<li><p>Will my audience understand the connections between my ideas? If
not, how can I help them?</p></li>
<li><p>Should all the information be in the document, or should some of it
be in attachments or links?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Using headings and subheadings, lists and paragraphs as some way to
organize a message to capture and keep your audience’s attention.</p>
<p><strong>Using Headings and Subheadings</strong></p>
<p>Headings and subheadings help to organize longer documents. Because the
text is larger and often bold, the reader’s attention is drawn to them.
Headings and subheadings are especially useful when you’re writing a
document like a report, which often has different audiences looking for
different types of information.</p>
<p>To write effective headings:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Use parallelism:</strong> When you start a pattern, you should keep using
it. For example, if you started with the heading “Email Conference
Attendees” and then used “Print Conference Brochures,” you would
disrupt the pattern if your next heading was “Contacting Catering
Service.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use consistent sizes and fonts:</strong> In your document, you might have
different “levels” of headings. Apply the same font and size to each
“level” of headings in your document.</p></li>
<li><p>**Use limited articles: **An article is a word like “the” or “a.”
Too many of these can crowd your headings. For example, instead of
saying “The Academic Barriers to Student Success,” you could say
“Academic Barriers to Student Success.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using Lists</strong></p>
<p>Lists are an easy way to show readers the connections between ideas.
Bullet points often draw the reader’s attention, so they’re the perfect
organizational aid for helping a reader to see the next steps or
important recommendations. Lists also remove the need for awkward
transition words like ‘firstly’ and ‘secondly.’ To write effective
lists:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Use parallelism:</strong> Again, if you start a pattern, you should
continue it.</p></li>
<li><p>**Keep between 3 to 6 bullet points: **Too many bullet points are
hard for readers to follow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Punctuate the list effectively</strong>: If you’re using a paragraph
list, put a colon after the topic sentence, then capitalize the
first word.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Writing Effective Paragraphs</strong></p>
<p>Unlike punctuation, which can be subjected to specific rules, no
ironclad guidelines exist for shaping paragraphs. If you presented a
text without paragraphs to a dozen writing instructors and asked them to
break the document into logical sections, chances are that you would
receive different opinions about the best places to break the paragraph.
In part, where paragraphs should be placed is a stylistic choice. Some
writers prefer longer paragraphs that compare and contrast several
related ideas, whereas others stick to having one point per paragraph.
In the workplace, many writers use shorter paragraphs and even use
one-line paragraphs since this allows readers to scan the document
quickly. If your readers have suggested that you take a hard look at how
you organize your ideas, or if you are unsure about when you should
begin a paragraph or how you should organize final drafts, then you can
benefit by reviewing paragraph structure.</p>
<p>Structuring A Paragraph</p>
<p>We’ve already learned that every piece of workplace communication should
have a purpose. That’s also true of paragraphs. In general, you should
have one purpose per paragraph, although for the overall flow of the
document you might want to combine two points. Let’s take a look at this
customer service email.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th></th>
<th><em><strong>Purpose</strong></em></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Dear Ms. Tran,</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience as we investigated your missing clothing order, which you brought to our attention on Tuesday.</p></td>

<tr class="even">
<td>Once we received your email, we contacted both our warehouse and FedEx. The warehouse confirmed that your order was processed on Feb. 19th and FedEx confirmed that a shipping label was created on Feb. 20th. Unfortunately, we were not able to locate the package from that point.</td>

<td><em>Tells the reader what to do next.</em></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Thank you again for your patience. We appreciate your business and look forward to making this right.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Makiko Hamimoto</p></td>
<td><p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Ends the communication on a positive note, looking towards the future.</em></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><p>As you can see, most of the paragraphs have only one point. In short
communication, it’s enough to simply understand what role the paragraph
plays in your writing. In longer or more important communication, you
may choose to use topic sentences to structure your paragraphs.</p>
<p>Exercise:</p>
<p>Which of the following sentences are good examples of correct and clear
business English? For sentences needing improvement, describe what is
wrong (briefly) and write a sentence that corrects the problem. You can
type answers into the submission screen or in a Microsoft Word document
and submit as an attachment.</p>

<p>Scenario:</p>
<p>The accounting department at the The Maple All-Suite Hotel has indicated
to the management that funds are available to make an upgrade to the key
card system at the hotel. The Maple All-Suite Hotel is a boutique hotel
that is located in Vancouver and has 90 rooms. The recently upgraded key
card system has received numerous guest complaints that their key cards
were malfunctioning. The employees find it challenging to use the manual
to fix the problem because it uses long and uses technical language. The
Duty Manager, Donneil Chance, was asked to extract the relevant
information from the 500-page manual and simplify the language to make
it easier for the team to understand. While doing so, she notices that
the manual has troubleshooting instructions related to all potential
guest and employee issues with the new system. However, this information
has no clear sections or headings. In hospitality, the goal is to
resolve all guest issues as quickly as possible. It would be
time-consuming for an employee to find the information they need to
solve any problems promptly using the manual in its current format.</p>
<p><em>How should Donneil organize the required information into a simplified
manual?</em></p>

<h4>MODULE DESCRIPTION<a class="headerlink" href="#id9" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>All accountants, no matter their specialty, write memorandums and emails
to a variety of people. Memorandum, sometimes called “memos” are often
used for communication within an organization—between departments, for
example, or between a supervisor and other members of the staff. Emails
are used almost universally for both personal and business use. This
module deals with how to compose a memorandum and how to use business
emails appropriately for communication within an organization and with
external constituency groups, such as individual or corporate clients.
For example, a tax accountant might write a letter seeking data about a
client’s tax situation or to clarify issues for a client. This module
deals with those issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id10">
<h4>MODULE OBJECTIVES<a class="headerlink" href="#id10" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>After completing readings and assignments in this module, students
should be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Summarize and apply the basic guidelines for writing memos</p></li>
<li><p>Organize a coherent memo, with a focus on main ideas</p></li>
<li><p>Write memos in an effective style and tone</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate via email in a professional, effective manner</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>*MODULE ASSIGNMENTS:*</strong> (some assignments correspond with the
textbook)</p>
<p>1. In the  <em>Effective Writing: A Handbook for Accountants</em> textbook,
read Chapter 10 ( <em>Memos and Briefing Documents</em>) along with the
PowerPoint notes on writing memorandums. I have attached a handout which
can serve as a template for constructing memos.</p>
<p>Then, using the following scenario below, construct a memo that explains
the information. Please type the memo using Times New Roman or
Calibri font. You can use the template I provided as a guide, if
needed. The memo will be evaluated using the attached rubric.</p>
<p>Memo Scenario:</p>
<p>*You discover that the client’s previous tax returns from last year,
which someone else prepared, listed a deduction of $3,000 in excess of
the actual expenditure. This mistake was not intention and the IRS will
probably not detect the error. You can present the client with two
options: change the error, which might cost the client additional
liability OR prepare the return from the previous year so that the
mistake was yours (as the tax preparer). Create a price structure for
each option. Indicate to the client that you want to meet to discuss
these options. *</p>
<p>For this assignment, feel free to add any additional information that
you feel the client would want to know about each option (this can come
from your own experiences, knowledge from other courses, etc).  You can
be creative with some of the information in the memo, such as name,
date, etc.</p>
<p>Please submit the completed memo as an attachment.</p>

<div><p>**Memorandum **</p>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">To:       WRIT 440 Students</div>
<div class="line">From:</div>
<div class="line">Date:    September 16, 2019</div>
<div class="line">Re:       How to Write a Memo</div>
</div>
<p>Your instructor has asked you to write a memo, which is the most common
form of written communication in business. In order to perform this task
successfully, you should conform to general business standards of
content, format, structure and language use. Business Memo’s also follow
the “ABC” Abstract/Body/Conclusion Format.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Content</strong></div>
<div class="line">The first rule of writing a good memo is “Get to the point!” The second
rule is “Know what your point is.” <em>Before</em> you start writing, be sure
that you know what your “answer” is to the boss’s or colleague’s
question. Do not include all your thinking in the memo. While several
pages of thinking might get written as you come up with the answer, the
memo includes <em>only</em> the answer. Citations, financials, or
justifications that must be available to the reader can be added as
appendices. The memo should include only those ideas that are required
for the reader’s action or decision.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Format</strong></div>
<div class="line">This memo is an example of memo format. Note especially the routing
information, the use of headings, and the single spaced block
paragraphs.  If your memo <em>looks</em> like a memo, there’s a better chance a
business reader will take your ideas seriously.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Structure</strong></div>
<div class="line">The typical memo is only two or three paragraphs and fits on one page.
The first paragraph summarizes the main idea of the whole memo (often
called the “abstract”), then the main points are covered in the same
order they were previewed (the body). Again, this memo provides an
example of the typical structure. The last part of the memo should be a
“conclusion” where you tell the reader what the next steps in the
process might be.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Language Use</strong></div>
<div class="line">A memo is often less formal than a letter but should still be written
with a businesslike tone. You can be friendly, but not cute. Your
professional image depends on perfect spelling and grammar, but you can
usually get away with a few “down home” expressions. Edit for wordiness
and get directly to the point. Use language to communicate your ideas
effectively and efficiently.</div>

</div></blockquote>
<p>An accountant working in the public or private sector must remain
impartial and loyal to ethical guidelines when reviewing a company or
individual’s financial records for reporting purposes. An accountant
frequently encounters ethical issues regardless of the industry and must
remain continually vigilant to reduce the chances of outside forces
manipulating financial records, which could lead to both ethical and
criminal violations.</p>
<p>Pressure From Management</p>
<p>The burden for public companies to succeed at high levels may place
undue stress and pressure on accountants creating balance sheets and
financial statements. The ethical issue for these accountants becomes
maintaining true reporting of company assets, liabilities and profits
without giving in to the pressure placed on them by management or
corporate officers. Unethical accountants could easily alter company
financial records and maneuver numbers to paint false pictures of
company successes. This may lead to short-term prosperity, but altered
financial records will ultimately spell the downfall of companies when
the Securities and Exchange Commission discovers the fraud.</p>
<p>Accountant as Whistleblower</p>
<p>An accountant may face the ethical dilemma of reporting discovered
accounting violations to the Financial</p>
<p>Accounting Standards Board. While it is an ethical accountant’s duty to
report such violations, the dilemma arises in the ramifications of the
reporting. Government review of company financial records and the bad
press caused by an accounting scandal could cause the company’s rapid
decline and may lead to the layoff of thousands of employees.</p>
<p>Executives and other corporate officers could also face criminal
prosecution, leading to heavy fines and prison time.</p>
<p>The Effects of Greed</p>
<p>Greed in the business and finance world leads to shaving ethical
boundaries and stepping around safeguards in the name of making more
money. An accountant can never let the desire to earn a better living
and acquire more possessions get in the way of ensuring that she follows
ethical guidelines for financial reporting. An accountant who keeps her
eyes on her own bank account more than on her company’s balance sheet
becomes a liability to the company and may cause real accounting
violations, resulting in sanctions from the SEC.</p>
<p>Omission of Financial Records</p>
<p>A corporate officer or other executive may ask an accountant to omit or
leave out certain financial figures from a balance sheet that may paint
the business in a bad light to the public and investors. Omission may
not seem like a</p>
<p>significant breach of accounting ethics to an accountant because it does
not involve direct manipulation of numbers or records. This is precisely
why an accountant must remain ethical.</p>

<p><em>Scenario:</em></p>
<p><em>Rosalie works as the controller in a moderate-sized non-profit
organization dedicated to enhancing access to clean water and food in
developing countries. The organization she works for is fairly
well-known because of the organization’s fundraising strategy.
Specifically, Rosalie’s company buys numerous long TV spots that air
during the overnight hours. Using images from some of the organization’s
most important projects, viewers are shown just how much their donations
could help people of these impoverished, often war-torn regions.</em></p>
<p><em>A recent change at the executive level has placed her in an
increasingly unenviable position. The new CEO is not quite ‘’by the
book’’ in terms of his expense account. Walking in to the office one
day, Rosalie is surprised to see a truly magnificent salt-water fish
tank, a new addition to the lobby. The tank is several hundred gallons
in size, and holds several thousand dollars worth of exotic fish. When
she asks a colleague where it came from, her co-worker tells her the CEO
purchased it. ‘’I guess everybody has their hobby.’’ Rosalie mutters
under her breath.</em></p>
<p><em>Her mild annoyance at the expensive hobby turns decidedly darker a few
weeks later when the CEO’s purchasing card has charges totaling nearly
$3,000 for what he labeled ‘’miscellaneous facilities expenses.’’ As
Rosalie suspects, most of that money was ‘’invested’’ in the fish tank.
Later that night as Rosalie watches TV, one of her organization’s
2-minute TV spots rolls. The spot claws at the heart as it depicts
people whose lives have been destroyed by poverty and violence. When the
spot ends with the usual appeal for a’’gift’’ of $30 a month, Rosalie
feels ill. ‘’I doubt anyone picking up the phone right now is aware that
part of their donation is funding a massive fish tank!’’ What, if
anything, should Rosalie do right now if she wants to demonstrate the
highest regard for professional ethics?</em></p>
