The Teaching Guide for the Major in Rhetoric is under development. 

.. admonition:: Recommend a Student

    Rhetoric majors gain the skills and tools of effective communication by learning to speak and design effectively while also becoming discerning critics of the communication practices saturating our world.  Students take speech, writing, and rhetorical theory classes that examine communication in interpersonal, community, civic, academic, professional and historical contexts.

    Enjoying this course? Consider the Rhetoric Major or Professional Writing Minor! Rhetoric majors take 11 writing, speech, and rhetorical theory courses. They learn how language and other symbols shape meaning, experience, identity, and point of view, and they become powerful speakers and writers. Professional writing minors take six professional communication courses that build the writing, speaking, teamwork, and project management skills employers are seeking. For more information contact: Karen Forgette, Rhetoric Major Advisor, `kforgett@olemiss.edu <mailto:kforgett@olemiss.edu>`_; or Dr. Karla Lyles, Professional Writing Minor Coordinator, `kmlyles@olemiss.edu <mailto:kmlyles@olemiss.edu>`_).

      Our department houses the BA in Rhetoric, which is the study and practice of effective communication. In SPCH 102 we do this by learning how to adapt to an audience and create messages that will reach them. Rhetoric majors go on to graduate school or work in industry doing things like corporate communication, writing, editing, public advocacy, or anything that involves writing and/or speaking. I am happy to fill out the recommendation form so you will hear from the advisor, Ms. Karen Forgette, so you can get more information about the major.
